This is the basic circuit design for the current project, 
DIS in this case refers to a buck converter/ other power distribution method to power the arduino
and misc motors using the battery pack on hand.

Major Moving Parts: 
	The major moving parts in this project will be the motors, microcontrollers,
and the necessary power distribution components. This will allow the core functions of the bike to work
which will be the wheels turning, changing direction, and the gyroscope to be able to spool up with the 
help of the sensors. The main idea is that this needs to be a functional bike with gyroscopic capabilities,
this means that the priorities will be the motors and the ability to supply those motors. Another big factor
would be the frame of the bike as well, since a poorly designed frame would make all the difference in the world
in terms of how well the bike would operate. For example, if the frame makes the gyroscope not be in the center
of mass then that would mean that it would no longer be as effective.
    
Priorities and Dependencies: Reflected in tickets

Design Approaches: 
	We already know what kind of motors, drivers, microcontrollers, etc. that we would need.
The main challenge is to be able to choose a specific component in the market that matches our needs
for a reasonable price. For example, if the motor we buy is too weak or too cheap, it may not be able to
reach the rpm that we need or not have enough torque to spin the mass with enough efficacy.
