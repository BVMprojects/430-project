9/3/2024 - We created the github and began to think of what to do for the project. 
We thought of two ideas so far, which are as follows:
  Fan controlled through a relay
    -Uses a microcontroller and a relay to shut a fan on and off based on the readings of a temp sensor
  Gyroscope bike
    -Standard RC bike, but it involves a gyroscope to keep it upright. This involves a microcontroller giving signals to various servos,
    and likely using PWM to control the voltage of the gyroscope. The main challenge would be the power distribution, since there will be a standard brushless motor
    for the gyroscope, and the rest will be servos. We can program the bike to move or we could set it up to be remote controlled
9/5/2024 - 2nd class, finalizing what we want for our project
Decided on the gyroscopic bike
  -using a drone motor and a spinning disk
  -the rest of the bike will be done with servos
we will use the github wiki for the documentation
