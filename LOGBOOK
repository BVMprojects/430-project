9/3/2024 - We created the github and began to think of what to do for the project. 
We thought of two ideas so far, which are as follows:
  Fan controlled through a relay
    -Uses a microcontroller and a relay to shut a fan on and off based on the readings of a temp sensor
  Gyroscope bike
    -Standard RC bike, but it involves a gyroscope to keep it upright. This involves a microcontroller giving signals to various servos,
    and likely using PWM to control the voltage of the gyroscope. The main challenge would be the power distribution, since there will be a standard brushless motor
    for the gyroscope, and the rest will be servos. We can program the bike to move or we could set it up to be remote controlled
9/5/2024 - 2nd class, finalizing what we want for our project
Decided on the gyroscopic bike
  -using a drone motor and a spinning disk
  -the rest of the bike will be done with servos
we will use the github wiki for the documentation
9/10/2024 - During Class
Main question, how will the bike know when to activate the stabilizer?
  Decided on researching different sensors/ ideas.
  Battery pack, microcontroller, motor drivers, and the DC motors would be the major moving parts.
  The objective will be to only stabilize when needed, otherwise it will interfere with the bike leaning into corners.
  Encasing and framing will be made in the makerspace, likely 3d printed. 
  How will the bike be controlled? Most likely rc which would mean a radio receiver and a controller that will send out the signal
